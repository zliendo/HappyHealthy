# HAPPYHEALTHY 

**April 2014**

HappyHealth is a Mobile App that encourages and facilitates peers social support during a health intervention program.    
I implemented this mobile app as the final project for MITx-edx class: Building Mobile Experiences, which I took on April 2014.

Built an Android Mobile Application, starting with generative research and continuing with design, implementation and field evaluation. The App connected to Liferay as the application server backend for message boards and image library repositories.
